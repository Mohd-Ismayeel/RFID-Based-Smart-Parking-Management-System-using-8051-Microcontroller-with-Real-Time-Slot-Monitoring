# Keil Project Manual

This folder contains the Keil C code for the 8051 Smart Parking System project.

## File:
- 8051.c : Main C source code for the project

## How to Use:
1. Open **Keil ÂµVision** software.
2. Open the project file or create a new project and add `8051.c` to it.
3. Ensure the correct microcontroller (AT89C51 / 8051) is selected in project settings.
4. Compile the project to generate the HEX file.
5. Copy the generated HEX file to the location linked in the Proteus simulation (`PARK.pdsprj`).

## Notes:
- Do not modify the Proteus project file unless necessary.
- Delay values and port connections can be adjusted in `8051.c` to match your simulation setup.
- Always compile in Keil before running the Proteus simulation to reflect code changes.
