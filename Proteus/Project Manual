# Proteus Project Manual

This folder contains the Proteus simulation file for the 8051 Smart Parking System project.

## File:
- PARK.pdsprj : Main Proteus simulation project file

## How to Use:
1. Open **Proteus** software.
2. Go to **File → Open** and select `PARK.pdsprj`.
3. Ensure the compiled HEX file from Keil is in the correct location (linked in the project).
4. Start the simulation:
   - Entry and Exit push buttons simulate car movement.
   - LCD displays current parking count.
   - Motors simulate gates for entry and exit.
5. Observe the system working according to button presses and car count updates.

## Notes:
- Do **not delete** this file — it serves as a reference manual.
- Make sure Proteus version is compatible with the components used (8051, 16x4 LCD, DC motors).
- Use Keil to recompile the HEX file if you make changes in `8051.c`.
